=== CHECK LIST FOR CREATING AN AIMA-JAVA RELEASE ===

--- Create the Release 
*. Checkout the latest version of all the projects into a clean workspace.

*. Ensure the revisions # in the build.properties files of each project are updated.

*. Ensure the revision #s in the pom.xml file in aima-core is set to match the one in 
   build.properties.

*. Ensure the README.txt file in each project is updated to reflect the release (i.e.
   update the 'Current Release' section at a minimum).
   
*. Commit changes to SVN server for each project updated.

*. run the aima-all.release ant task from the aima-all project.

--- Update the JavaDoc
*. Ensure all of the aima-all/release .html, .css, and .jnlp files have there Subversion svn:mime-type
   property set correctly
   .html=text/html
   .css=text/css
   .jnlp=application/x-java-jnlp-file
   
  otherwise the content will not be served up correctly by the Subversion server.

*. Upload the latest version of the aima-core Javadoc \:
   This can be done by running the aima-core.makedocs ant task and copying
   the generated docs over to the public Javadoc location in:
   aima-all\release\javadoc\aima-core
  
   for details on ensure the svn:mime-type is correctly set for the generated
   Javadocs see:
   http://stuffthathappens.com/blog/2007/11/09/howto-publish-javadoc-on-google-code/
   for details on how to do this. 
   
   Note: Best to use TortoiseSVN and ensure the config file is setup correctly, i.e.:
   ...
   ### Section for configuring miscelleneous Subversion options.
   [miscellany]
   ...
   ### Automatic properties are defined in the section 'auto-props'.
   enable-auto-props = yes
   ...
   ### Section for configuring automatic properties.
   [auto-props]
   *.txt = svn:mime-type=text/plain
   *.html = svn:mime-type=text/html
   *.css = svn:mime-type=text/css
   *.png = svn:mime-type=image/png
   *.jpg = svn:mime-type=image/jpeg
   *.jnlp = svn:mime-type=application/x-java-jnlp-file

--- Update the Java Web Start Applications

*. Copy the .jar files generated by the aima-all.release ant task from:
   aima-all/build/release/release 
   
   to:
   
   aima-all/release/jars

*. Create a keystore which will be used to sign the copied jars, e.g.:

   > keytool -genkey -keystore c:/temp/aima3e.keystore -alias aima3e
   
   > Enter keystore password: <Enter an appropriate password>
   > Re-enter new password: <Same password>
   > What is your first and last name?
       [Unknown]: <Your Name>
   > What is the name of your organizational unit?
       [Unknown]: AIMA-Java Open Source Project 
   > What is the name of your organization?
       [Unknown]: AIMA-Java Open Source Project
   > What is the name of your City or Locality?
       [Unknown]: Mountain View
   > What is the name of your State or Province?
       [Unknown]: California
   > What is the two-letter country code for this unit?
       [Unknown]: US 
   > ...
       [no]: yes
       
 *. Sign each jar individually, e.g.:
   > jarsigner -keystore c:/temp/aima3e.keystore aima-core.jar aima3e
   > jarsigner -keystore c:/temp/aima3e.keystore aima-gui.jar aima3e
   > jarsigner -keystore c:/temp/aima3e.keystore aimax-osm.jar aima3e
   > jarsigner -keystore c:/temp/aima3e.keystore commons-compress-1.1.jar aima3e
   
*. commit the changes to the aima-all project
