Heap.py -- Heap queue algorithm, class version.
V.1.5, Jan 18 2007, by bearophile

This class provides an implementation of the heap queue algorithm, also known as the
priority queue algorithm, using the heapq standard module.

Heaps are arrays for which heap[k] <= heap[2*k+1] and heap[k] <= heap[2*k+2] for all k,
counting elements from zero. For the sake of comparison, non-existing elements are
considered to be infinite. The interesting property of a heap is that heap[0] is always its
smallest element.

The API below differs from textbook heap algorithms in two aspects: (a) We use zero-based
indexing. This makes the relationship between the index for a node and the indexes for its
children slightly less obvious, but is more suitable since Python uses zero-based indexing.
(b) Our pop method returns the smallest item, not the largest (called a "min heap" in
textbooks; a "max heap" is more common in texts because of its suitability for in-place
sorting).

To create a Heap, you can give it a sequence, or you can create an empty Heap and
popultate it later.

Some doctests:

>>> data = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0]
>>> h = Heap()
>>> bool(h)
False
>>> for item in data:
...     h.push(item)
>>> bool(h)
True
>>> h
Heap([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
>>> len(h)
10
>>> h.smallest()
0
>>> 7 in h
True
>>> 10 in h
False
>>> set((h,))
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
TypeError: Heap objects are unhashable.
>>> h
Heap([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
>>> h.replace(-5)
0
>>> h
Heap([-5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
